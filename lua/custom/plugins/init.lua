  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.gitsigns', -- adds gitsigns recommend keymaps_table

  { import = 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line' },
  { import = 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs' },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
  --

  -- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
  -- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
  --    {
  --        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
  --        config = function()
  --            require('gitsigns').setup({
  --                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
  --            })
  --        end,
  --    }
  --
  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`.
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
  -- { -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
  --   'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
  --   opts = {
  --     signs = {
  --       add = { text = '+' },
  --       change = { text = '~' },
  --       delete = { text = '_' },
  --       topdelete = { text = 'â€¾' },
  --       changedelete = { text = '~' },
  --     },
  --   },
  -- },
  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin
